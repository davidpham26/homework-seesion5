    <h1>5. Groups of selectors</h1>
    <table class="size">
        <thead>
            <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the
                individual  <br> selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors
                share the same <br> declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may
                appear before and/or after the <br> comma.</p>

                <td class="yellow">CSS example: <br> In this example, we condense three rules with identical
                    daclarations into one. Thus, <br><br>h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br><br>h2 { font-family:
                    sans-serif } <br><br>h3 { font-family: sans-serif } <br><br>is equivalent to: <br><br>h1, h2, h3 {
